# Overworld chart
this is an attempt at a 3D map ui for storing info in a more "Overworld" like approch, much like the overworlds of video games and fantasy cartogrophy.
the intended implimentation of this is to use something akin to a 3d engine to display a map object that we can then texture and add elements ontop of.
Hopefully we can make this whole thing 3d and keep the overall rendering needed low to keep this as low level as we need.
there are a handful of ways we can impliment this but for now we are going to experiment to find the best way to do so.

## Notes

- Likely going to start with three.js
- made a small 3d model in blender to use in three.js
- also going to use a test map [that i found on a reddit post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/inkarnate/comments/w109fx/alurna_just_a_good_ol_homebrew_fantasy_map_for_my/) its not mine and i wont claim it but it was used as an easy find example that can be refrenced.
